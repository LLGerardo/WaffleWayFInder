Everything was perfect, staff at the front desk were very friendly and knowledgeable, everyone we ran into was professional and nice, the room was super comfy. We had a suite with a kitchenette (microwave, refrig with freezer unit, coffee maker, dishes, flatware, glasses for water and wine), 2 televisions - one in the bedroom the other in the living room. The seating was very comfortable and a table to eat. I highly recommend this property. We were in town to see the play Hamilton, we were easily able to walk to the Gas Lamp for dinner and then to the Civic Theater.Thank you for a perfect review!

Staring with parking you are paying 12.00 for a spot that you have to do a 3 point turn to get into and my Camry almost didnt fit into. The room was super small for being a family suite and everything was cramped. The was enough space between the foot of the bed and the tv table was wide enough for a vacuum to fit though as well as the space between the bed and the wall. The second room was divided by a French door only the fixed side of the French door had window covering so there is no privacy between rooms and the lights from either room shines into each other. The AC was weak and smelt like mold. The second room never got air and by the time you go to the bathroom forget it just open the window to let the air in. There is no circulation, except what was provided by a large fan in the wall between rooms that was extremely loud and reminded me of an attic fan. One good thing the bed was comfortable for a single night stay. This location does offer breakfast, but after making a waffle and getting a plate together and sitting down to eat each of us took a bite and ended up at Dennys down the street. I wasnt expecting a Hilton or the Ritz Carlton, but I was expecting something a little higher than what ended up looking like highway motel. Lucky for us we were there only one night before heading home to Los Angeles.Dear Guest,Thank you very much for your honest and detailed feedback on your recent stay at our hotel.

Smallish room--tastefully appointed with touches I've seen in high-end hotels--was cozy and comfortable. It's in the heart of downtown, so we expected to hear city sounds from the room, but we slept well and comfortably in a room overlooking the street. The crowning grace, though, was the excellent and helpful staff. We forgot to make dinner reservations and was out shopping, but a call to the concierge got us an 8pm table on Saturday night in a highly-rated restaurant.

We stayed in a large, well-appointed suite with a nice view. We were somewhat disappointed by the fact that rooms are on the lower half of the bldg, as the upper half is reserved for residents. The result is that the W just down the street, while not of the same caliber, has infinitely better views. So, ask for floors 14-20. Below that, it s just too low.Second point of criticism - and this applies to all St Regis butlers: they creep us out! These guys need to be less awkward / better trained / older than 15. Now, for the good stuff: Nice pool area, very good spa treatments, and a rather hopping and pleasant lobby bar. The Japanese restaurant was also rather on the nice side. The location is obviously fantastic, with SF Moma half a block away, and all the shops a couple of blocks away.Overall, a relaxing St Regis - not their best hotel, but definitely the best in San Francisco.","Best in

The Warf is a great area, but it is all tourists. When we go to SF, we like to walk (a lot) and visit the places the locals go. The Hotel Vertigo is in a great location for branching out all over the city. And, on those days when you just want to hang out - there are plenty of restaurants and bars within blocks. Hotel Vertigo is a seven story boutique hotel. Over the last couple of years I have made the decision to only stay in boutique hotels, and Hotel Vertigo does not disappoint. The rooms are small, but very well appointed. It is apparent that my room had recently been renovated with modern chic. The bathroom was huge with a great rain shower head. The room was on par with some of my recent stays in Madrid and Mexico City. Excellent WiFi coverage all over the hotel. My only complaint was that I had an inside corner room (709) on the 7th floor that adjoined another room. The door to the adjoining room was not very sound proof so I almost clearly heard TV and conversation in the next room. This was only a problem one night for about an hour before a fell to sleep after a long day of exploring the city. The staff here are amazing. They were always ready to help us with directions, taxis and recommendations. The rooms are cleaned very quickly each day with great detail. My friends have been staying at Hotel Vertigo for years and I'm glad they convinced me to stay here this time. I'll be back in a few months with my girlfriend and I know she will love the Hotel Vertigo. Dear Cortesokc,Thank you very much for your comprehensive review of your experience in San Francisco while staying at the Hotel Vertigo.

What we found was a rather worn and tattered, rock-n-roll hotel with a dated atmosphere. The room was clean, but again, a little worn. The service was okay, but our room was not ready when we arrived a bit early, but we were told it would not be ready for over an hour AFTER check-in time. We were able to check our bags at the desk, and we went for an early cocktail, but chose another place once we saw the kind of seedy bar. Room service was quick, but the food was just average. I have a feeling this outpost of the W brand is in for a major shakeup. The price of rooms here is high, and I just don't see why. We also stayed at the Hyatt Olive 8, and the experience was MUCH better. I would skip the W Seattle. You will not get what you pay for.Hello JJHappyTraveler, many thanks for your recent review on your stay at W Seattle. We apologize that we missed the mark with you and your partner. Our goal is to provide a fabulous experience for our guests, and when we fall short of that, we take it very seriously.

The staff were pleasant, very helpful and upbeat. It's a great location right in the center of many historical sights! It's walking distance to sights like Penn's Landing, the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall. The hotel is across from the US Mint, next to Ben Franklin's grave and near some good eateries like Sonny's and Happily Ever After. It also offers its own restaurant, bar and fitness center. Free wifi. It was a reasonable rate for the area. Parking was 36.75 for overnight but you can keep your car there the next day until 5pm. However you may be able to find a cheaper garage nearby. As far as the rooms themselves go- those I would rate a little lower. The room was a little on the small side and definitely could have been cleaner (like the bathroom and under the beds) but it was adequate and by no means did I feel like it was so dirty I wouldn't stay the night. Rooms are probably a 3 however. The room did have a coffee maker, microwave and mini refrigerator which was great! They are updating some different features so maybe this was part of it. Dear Trip Advisor Guest,Thank you for your feedback. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay and I would agree that we are in the perfect location to visit many of the historical sites in the area. It's a great part of town. Thank you again and we hope to see you back sometime in the near future.

The only complaint was the ice machine was near our room and it was making lots of noise. They were able to fix the problem the next day.The breakfast bar and appetizers were very good. Lots of variety and plenty to eat. If you are going with children or teenagers, it is very good on your food budget. The hotel was near the St Charles trolley line and Jackson Square.

This hotel was pretty much on par with most except for a couple drawbacks. The rooms are small - not a lot of extra space at all. The breakfast room is really cramped as well and there isn't a ton of seating although we didn't have an issue finding a table. The rooms were nice though and staff was helpful. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance, which is nice. Fortunately we didn't spend a lot of time in our room, so the cramped space wasn't an issue. I'd stay here again unless my travels required a larger room.Hello,Thanks for reviewing our property. We truly appreciate you rating our property 4 out of 5.

Checked out the website and everything looked great...it boasts free shuttle service to Disneyland and Knotts and that it is a mile and a half away from Disneyland. Try about 5 miles. Took forever to find it. It was in this wierd, old part of town, off the beaten path, right on the main drag of Brookhurst street. Outside appearance was a little icky. It had an unattractive closed down restaurant as part of the hotel and an old shuttle that was sitting in the front. To our dismay, there were no longer any shuttle services offered. The rooms were old and a little bit dingy. You can hear people in the other rooms taking showers. The beds were not at all comfortable. TV got only a few stations. Definately not what we expected. We thought it was going to be a classy hotel by Disneyland. We felt slightly misled by the website. The perks The rooms had a microwave and little refridgerator. The pool was nice and secluded, very quiet and clean. My nephew and I swam for 2 hours, all alone! We were the only ones out there, it was great! Friendly staff, willing to help.

The place is just 10 minutes walk from the Convention Center. The road from the enter to the hotel is uphill. My room was clean and spacious, with a closet. The windows faced downhill with a broad view. The only problem was a fan below the windows. I heard its noise when I opened the window. Nevertheless, my overall rating is very good.Dear mikhail534, Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Hotel Sorrento.I am so pleased to know that you enjoyed the hotel's location and the guestroom appointments, I am, however, disappointed to learn of fan noise, when you opened the window. Please know that I very much appreciate your feedback, as it is only in this way that we can improve upon our shortcomings.

But, when there to dine and visit wineries without children, swimming pool irrelevant. But families with children who want to play in the pool, or adults that want to swim some laps be advised that this is not the Motel swimming pool for you. Good, adequate complimentary breakfast (2 choices) with coffee or tea at Denny's next door.

For our purposes, it was the perfect hotel.It was booked via our travel agent, and when I afterwards saw previous Tripadvisor reviews, I was quite concerned. However, I'm really glad we weren't put off by them.It's clearly quite an old hotel, and we were staying in one of the motel-style rooms in the main part of the hotel. As Brits on holiday for the first time in America, it felt like lovely quaint Americana. The fittings and furniture were clearly new a good few decades ago, but everything was functional and clean. The staff were helpful and polite. The location is great for public transport - just a few minutes' walk to Market Street, and then you're right next to MUNI stops, and the Civic Center BART station, so travel around the city and beyond is very convenient.It's a very limited breakfast (but that's advertised), and a great bonus is that it's right next door to Sightglass - a lovely coffee roastery and coffee bar, if you want a good coffee to start the day. You're also right around the corner from two excellent craft beer bars - City Beer Store, and Cellarmaker.Being in the South of Market area (SOMA), you do feel you need your wits about you if out after dark, but it's the same in any city really.Overall, if you want a stylish hotel with modern fittings, this isn't it. But we wanted a budget hotel in the centre of the city for a holiday, and it was perfect for us.","Very good budget hotel in a great location","Nottingham","UnitedKingdom","Hannah253","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or15-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or65-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or205-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or190-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or150-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or135-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or175-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or55-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or80-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or20-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.yellowbook.com/profile/city-center-inn-and-suites-san-francisco_1904349330.html,http://www.citysearch.com/profile/866239/san_francisco_ca/city_center_inn_suites_san_francisco.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or90-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or95-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or165-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or130-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or140-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or45-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or50-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81246-Reviews-or10-City_Center_Inn_Suites_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS","https://www.sfcitycenterinnandsuites.com"

I was in town with a bus load of University of Louisville fans to support our basketball team during the game with DePaul University. There were not enough suites available with two double beds at the hotel to accommodate our group. So, I had to share a king-sized bed with my roommate. We were really disappointed that we couldn't have our own bed. So, we each rotated sleepng in the bed one night and then sleeping on the sofa bed in the living room. However, the sofa bed was absoultely horrible!!! The mattress was very thin and the inner springs poked through the surface of the mattress. This made sleeping very uncomfortable. Also, the top portion of the mattress where your head goes was higher than the rest of the mattress. I felt like I was sleeping on a slant. The mattress was so uncomfortable until I closed the sofa bed and replaced the cushions. Then I tried putting the cover on top and sleepng on top of the sofa, However, I am 5'11 tall and the sofa was more like a loveseat size. So, I could not stretch out completely. I got very little sleep and awoke stiff and sore. My back and neck hurt. It was also awkward having to go through the bedroom to use the toilet and shower in the bathroom or to get clothes from the closet without disturbing my roommate while she slept in the bed. The layout of the suite was not well-thoughout as far as utilization of the bathroom and closet.On the plus side of the suite, the kitchen was wonderful! We liked having a fully equipped kitchen with appliances and dishes. We also enjoyed the breakfast! Shirley Fuqua-Jackson, Room 1203Shirley, I am sorry that you did not enjoy your stay at the hotel. I wanted to address your concern about not receiving a room with two double beds. When looking back at the original rooming list that we have from your group leader we do not have you and your roommate in a room with two double beds. The room type that your group leader had assigned to your room was a King Suite with the sleeper sofa. The hotel des have a very limited number of double/double rooms on property so we were unable to change room types if we do not have the availability. I do want to express regret over this misunderstanding. I do apologize for the uncomfortable evening that you spent on our sleeper sofa. We are in the process of replacing all of our bed inserts and we do hope that nobody will be as inconvenienced as you in the future. We do have a limited number of complimentary roll-away beds available if you find the sleeper sofa too uncomfortable in the future. We are pleased that you enjoyed the breakfast and the full stocked kitchen. We do hope to see you again.

Location, Location, Location. The overall property is very good and the staff is outstanding. Unfortunately our initial experience was very rough but the property management took accountability, immediately fixed the issues and followed up repeatedly to ensure our satisfaction. My family checked into the three bedroom villa on December 26th for seven days at Disney World. The overall layout of the room is excelled and we enjoyed the screened in porch overlooking the golf course and pond (ducks included). Upon arriving, the villa floors were filthy, carpets stained and bar stools worn to threadbare state. We've stayed at many Marriott Vacation Club properties over the years and experienced beautiful, clean and new(er) villas. The cleanliness of our villa was out of the ordinary. I called the GM, Eugene, and he immediately brought his staff to our villa to assess the situation and offer apologies. He committed to having all fixed by the time we returned from Magic Kingdom later that day. Eugene and team came through with grace and excellence. The room was deep cleaned, carpets shampooed and furniture replaced with brand new pieces. The Vacation Club staff treated me and my family like Diamond status owners the rest of the week. Eugene and his team turned a situation into an experience we will never forget. Well done!Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

This was our grandchild's first trip away from home. Room 120 is marketed as a suite. It's not. It's a regular hotel room with 2 queen size beds and then a closet with a full size bed inside of it. I kid you not!The grandparents (us) wanted a seperate bedroom so we were stuck in the closet. There was not enough room for 2 adults to walk around in the room. You open the door and there's the bed. There was 6 from the edge of the opened door to the edge of the bed. The bed was up against the wall. There was one tv in the entire suite. That tv was outside of the closet bedroom. There was one side table lamp in the suite and that was not in the closet bedroom. The closet bedroom had a floor lamp on the opposite side of the closet from the bed and a blaring overhead light. There was just enough room in the closet bedroom to open one piece of luggage. There was a very small side table in the closet bedroom where one could put their clothes in...a bit tough if there's 2 adults in the closet bedroom staying 4 nights. What little carpet you were exposed to in the closet bedroom was sticky as though someone had spilled a soft drink by the side table.Had we known this we never would've booked here. Thus the reason for me writing to help other guests.The staff was extremely nice. We had rented a scooter and that was left in the hotel lobby overnight as none of the hotel rooms on the property would be able to accomodate a scooter. We were provided with plenty of clean towels in the one small bathroom in our suite.The pool was very clean.The breakfast consisted of frozen donuts (no microwave is available in the lobby eating area...if you wanted them heated up you had to take it to your room and use your microwave there), powdered scrambled eggs, bagels, small yogurts, a few pieces of fruit, milk, juice and coffee. Cereals were available from the bulk cereal dispenser and there was a waffle maker. The breakfast area was tiny. Since we stayed here from Oct 23 - Oct 27 there weren't a bunch of families to battle with in this breakfast area. I can not even fathom eating in the breakfast area during summer vacation, spring break, or during the holiday season when multiple families are in abundance. The seating consisted of 4 tables...2 tables accomodated 4 people and 2 tables accomodated 2 people (12 people total in the seating area). Of note, since this was something we had never experienced in any other hotels we've stayed in over a 40+ year span, there were two police vehicles parked outside the lobby with officers in the lobby that started one of our mornings off before heading to the Happiest Place on Earth. We didn't want to know what may have happened for their being there but the officers weren't there to partake in the breakfast, if you catch my drift.Parking was adequate and free. The maids like to trash talk about the guests in Spanish. This might be ok for persons who aren't Spanish-fluent, but we are. There's a sand pit playground area in the courtyard. It seemed to be in good repair. Our grandson didn't play in the area. I can't speak for any noise level this may cause in the rooms that surround the courtyard.Don't say you weren't warned. You get what you pay for. And no, we would never stay here again.","Room 120 is not a suite","Sedona","Arizona","TravelingBabyBoomers","http://www.yellowbook.com/profile/quality-inn-and-suites-anaheim-at-the-park_1897652794.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g29092-d75747-Reviews-or40-Quality_Inn_Suites_Anaheim_at_the_Park-Anaheim_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g29092-d75747-Reviews-or85-Quality_Inn_Suites_Anaheim_at_the_Park-Anaheim_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g29092-d75747-Reviews-or60-Quality_Inn_Suites_Anaheim_at_the_Park-Anaheim_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g29092-d75747-Reviews-or105-Quality_Inn_Suites_Anaheim_at_the_Park-Anaheim_California.html#REVIEWS,http://www.citysearch.com/profile/645725/anaheim_ca/quality_inn_suites_anaheim_at_the_park.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g29092-d75747-Reviews-or25-Quality_Inn_Suites_Anaheim_at_the_Park-Anaheim_California.html#REVIEWS","https://www.choicehotels.com/california/anaheim/quality-inn-hotels/cab70?pmf=yext&mc=llyxyxpx"

If you book enough in advance the prices are in line with the cheaper cost hotels. All BW hotels have decent beds, bathrooms, come with microwave and fridge with a good TV and channels. The housekeeping staff does a good job with the cleaning. They do not offer breakfast, but they do give Denny's breakfast vouchers and they offer a go bag in the morning with an apple, a granola bar, and a small water. I'm usually in too much of a hurry to get to Disneyland to where breakfast doesn't matter anyways. The Stovall's BW is a few hotels closer, but is usually a little more and they charge for parking, but they have a full breakfast. Both are good to stay in. The BW on Ball Rd is nice too, but the walk is further.","Stay there almost every Disney trip","California City","UnitedStates","Michael

The lobby grabs you as you enter. You'd swear you're just steps from a beach but you're in the middle of the mountains.Props to the staff! Carla Bhumi. Once you check in you are in good hands and on a very quality property. However, don't expect to check in before check in time. So, if you arrive early, expect to be told not yet. Parking right next to the hotel is limited. But there is a satellite lot just a few more steps away. Not a problem, unless it's raining. Speaking of which, it did on our trip, just enough to not be able to enjoy the outdoor pool which looked very inviting!The indoor pool does not allow any eating or drinking...eh not a fan of that policy. There is no smoking on the property, not even on your own balcony. Understandable because you're pretty close to your neighbors, but still would have liked to enjoy a cigar and beer in the evenings. Instead there's a rickety table and chair in the corner of the parking lot you can traipse to if you have to smoke. OK, unless it's raining.The rooms are exquisite - for budget style hotels. And you can't beat the location, right next to the Island at Pigeon Forge. Several attractions are within walking distance but drivers in Pigeon Forge are horrible. Some don't even look before they turn and run red lights. If you're with kids, be on the lookout.If you can't get enough Jimmy Buffet lifestyle, there's a Margaritaville restaurant and Margaritaville coffee shop less than a 5 minute walk away.Also, need to mention, the breakfast they serve is a cut above those you would find at other breakfast included budget hotels.This place is really done right. Would love to stay here again on my next visit to Pigeon Forge.Thank you for staying at our hotel and for sharing your great feedback. We are so happy your enjoyed your visit and look forward to seeing you during your next visit to Pigeon Forge.","Buffet on a Budget","Nashville","Tennessee","Chris H","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55270-d12545683-Reviews-Margaritaville_Island_Inn-Pigeon_Forge_Tennessee.html,https://www.yellowpages.com/pigeon-forge-tn/mip/margaritaville-island-inn-538313101","https://www.margaritavilleislandinn.com"

No Air conditioner, a fan is at your disposal on the ceiling, above the bed, and you can open the window.Bathroom is small, and especially needs to be renovated.For the same price you can leave in a much better Hotel in San Francisco.Dear Matthieu L,Thank you very much for taking your time to share your comment with us on TripAdvisor. I am so sorry to hear our hotel didn't meet your expectation. Our hotel offers different style of rooms and I wish we could offer you a different room if we have known this during your stay with us. Our hotel just recently updated all the guest rooms furniture such headboard, dressers, night stands and mini fridges. All the guest's floor hallway carpets are renewed and as well as lobby furniture. We are going to renew the guest's room carpet very soon, and also working on minor renovation in each guest's room. I hope you would give us a second chance for your next visit in San Francisco.

There is access that exits to the boardwalk and from there is beach access. Our room was ocean front. Our 3rd floor room had a balcony that looked down on the boardwalk and beach. We sat in the room because it was chilly out and watched the sunset. How great to open the door and hear the roar of the waves. Our room was nice. A little old but clean and quiet. The one negative is that the room was dark when the sun went down. There is breakfast daily. Underground parking that cost 15 a day.

Last January we visited and booked again this year because we were so delighted with the property. Travelling with two small dogs can be difficult and staying here made it quite easy. There is a reasonable fee of course, but everyone was kind and open to their presence. We had 3 adults staying in a ground floor room with two queen beds. There was plenty of room, the room was clean, there was a frig, coffee maker and micro wave. Great place to travel with young children. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful, housekeeping staff was cheerful and available to help with extra towels, etc. What more could you want from a beach front hotel with the most beautiful winter sunsets off the San Diego coast We wil be back soon!!First, I would like to thank you for taking the time to write this review. I am also glad you enjoyed your stay with us, and of course, your pets are always welcome here. We are one of the few properties that do accept pets and we know many by their names. You also mentioned the sunsets, where everyday is a unique experience!!!! That never gets old, and is one of the perks of managing this property!!","WINTER WONDERLAND","Huntington Beach","California","Scottysgirl01","http://www.yellowbook.com/profile/pacific-shores-inn_1898363766.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or45-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or370-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or160-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or405-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or385-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or60-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or420-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or205-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or400-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or415-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or115-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or145-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or130-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or250-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://foursquare.com/v/pacific-shores-inn/4bc01582920eb7136e91182c,http://www.citysearch.com/profile/11450506/san_diego_ca/pacific_shores_inn.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or350-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or440-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or500-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or65-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or180-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or270-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or390-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or480-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.yellowbook.com/profile/pacific-shores-inn_1898363766.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or365-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or155-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or395-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or485-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or5-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or70-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or495-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or40-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or10-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or435-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d83500-Reviews-or85-Pacific_Shores_Inn-San_Diego_California.html#REVIEWS","https://www.pacificshoresinn.com/,https://www.pacificshoresinn.com"

It's within walking distance to Seattle Center which makes it great if you're going to the Pacific Science Center which was the reason for our visit. The room was great and the staff was very helpful. It's kind of tucked away in a semi-industrial looking area which concerned me a little bit at first because we had our young children with us but after walking around the neighborhood at night I realized it wasn't a problem. There is a QFC (grocery store) just around the corner which was great for grabbing snacks for the room and a quick bite before we hit Seattle Center. You can walk to Pike Market from here but it's about 1.5 miles away. We just walked there during the day and took a cab back to the hotel at night. All in all I enjoyed the stay there and would recommend it if you want to be in the Seattle Center area.","Close to Seattle

First that it was walking distance to the Washington State Convention Center. However there was a very step hill going down up before arriving there. Need to be in somewhat of good shape. Second was the price was the best for the location to the near the convention center. The trade off for the price, is this is an older hotel. The bathroom is very small, with a small door way. The room I had was a good size, and had a kitchenette. The room was very clean internet was free. The only problem I had with the room was the refrigerator was leaking on the floor, which made the room smell odd on the second day, and carpet wet. I should told the management.I will probably stay there again again next year, because of the price location.Hi Traveler - Thanks so much for your kind review.

It was a great place to stay! The room was clean and comfortable, there was good coffee in the morning and it was not only within walking distance of Blind Willie's but the Jimmy Carter Presidential library as well. Would definitely stay here again.Thank you for your wonderful review! We appreciate your feedback and are happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay.

It is in the heart of the theater district and very close to public transit. The rooms were small but very clean and the bed was comfortable. I loved that they had a yoga mat in the room!

Close to Reading Market and convention center and Chinatown. Small but grand lobby. Rooms comfortable. Has Starbucks and restaurant bar in hotel. Decor is retro chic Security is good (need room key just to use elevator). Wifi is free.Tip: 15 for a glass of wine that costs 9 bottle is rediculous. Lots of bars within a 1 block walk. Tip 2: parking is 44 per night. Might want to take train in (several stops nearby).Thank you for being our guest at the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown.

Cons: Unbelievably small room. I mean comically small. My friend and I literally laughed upon entering the room. There was a twin sized bed with maybe 3 feet of room on all three sides of it before hitting the wall. Bathroom was roughly half the size of the room itself. No air conditioning. Luckily we were only staying one night. If we had paid for a room for two and booked this place for a week I think we would have gone mad. It was a corner room so maybe the other rooms are more spacey but regardless the room we were given should be used for storage.Also the breakfast was very poor. Weak spread, ran out of food and dishes/cutlery. I ate cereal out of a coffee mug. Chose that over toast with store bought pastries and cold coffee.

If the French Quarter is your scene, but you don't want to be right on the loud vomit-filled Bourbon street then this is a very good choice. The location is on the edge of the Quarter, within easy walking distance of the party, Jackson Square, the French Market, and many great restaurants. Some of the rooms here are very small, while others are quite large. We wanted a balcony, but accidentally booked a sun deck room, which is nothing like a private balcony. The sun deck is a large communal patio with several rooms opening out to it, and it has tall concrete walls with no view, and burning hot sun. This room was very small, with no windows, and so we asked for another room. Even though it was our fault that we booked the wrong type of room the staff was incredibly friendly and accomodating, and they moved us to a room with a balcony - luckily one was available because we were staying during the week and not the weekend. All of the balcony rooms look out over the garden patio, and not the street, but the room was very large and bright. The garden area is small but pleasant, and we did enjoy sitting out there for our morning coffee. The free breakfast here is very minimal - breads, coffee, and cereal, so it is good for a quick bite, but certainly not something to look forward to. One of the best things about this place is the staff. Incredibly friendly and helpful. Everyone is willing to answer questions, and they do it with a smile and without ever acting like they expect a tip. Of course we did tip, and they were always very genuine in their appreciation. We got great recommendations for restaurants within walking distance - one was Irene's, a popular creole restaurant with great food and a fun atmosphere, but a very long wait and the other restaurant we enjoyed was Sylvain which is a small funky place with great food. Also within easy waking distance we enjoyed Mr. B's Bistro for lunch, and a glass of wine at the Carousel Bar in the Hotel Monteleone. These are all nice places for sober or semi-sober grown ups, free of loud drunks wearing beads.While the French Quarter was interesting, one day was more than enough for me. It is not the fault of the Bienville House, but the whole Quarter smells of rotting garbage and other unpleasantries. While I enjoy a drink or two, Burbon Street had absolutely no appeal to me, full of 20-somethings walking down the street yelling, carrying their giant beers/drinks, covered in beads, and this starts at 10am. If that is for you, enjoy, but I didn't need more than 10 minutes of that, so if I were ever to return to NOLA I would most definitely stay in the beautiful Garden District - there are many beautiful historic hotels here, and if you stay on or near St. Charles Street you are near the cable street car and can easily get to the Quarter whenever you want. The Garden District also has many excellent restaurants, and is close to Magazine Street, which is where the real shopping is, assuming you want something other than t-shirts with obscene sayings on them.The Bienville House is a nice place, which could use some upgrades, and it is perfect if you want to spend your time in the French Quarter, but somewhat away from the worst of it. We loved the friendly and helpful staff here, and did enjoy many good things within walking distance. However, if non-stop drinking isn't your scene I would recommend looking into the Garden District - much more peaceful and beautiful, and an easy cable car ride to the Quarter when you want it.","Nice

Very laid back with a good vibe. We stayed 7 nights and loved our room. The only issue that didn't make it a five star stay was that the WiFi was down for 3 days. This made it difficult to book restaurants, check our flights and generally keep in touch. The hotel seemed lost over the issue and didn't communicate the problem to their guests. The staff were efficient and friendly and we can't wait to go backThank you for taking the time to share your experience staying at the Outrigger Reef Waikiki Beach Resort and for the high recommendation.

Great place, nice breakfast, and very large rooms. The staff are amazing and very ready and willing to help. It the kind of place that I would recommend to anyone and everyone. There is a kitchen in the room, but all the nice dinning restaurants are well within an easy walk.Hi Tony W, Thank you for the great review! We are flattered by your comments and glad that our location over the Pacific set the tone for an unforgettable stay. We look forward to creating many more wonderful memories for you in the future.

I knew that there would be renovations going on during our stay, but it did not impact us in the least. You wouldn't have even know they were renovating. The hotel is in a perfect location, one block off of the main street in the Gaslamp Quarter so you may walk to many restaurants, shops, the stadium, the convention center, Seaport Village and even the USS Midway. The manager Shannon is lovely and made sure our stay was perfect. The front deck staff was exceptional. George and I believe Tim were always available to give us directions and to give us great recommendations on nearby restaurants. We were traveling with our two teenage boys and they knew just where to direct us depending on whether the boys were going to join us for our outings. The bellboys/door attendants/Valets were always at the doors greeting us with a smile and an open door. When I asked one of them if they ever tire of opening the doors and smiling he responded with a smile and said, never. Also, a fun thing that you can do before you leave home is send them a few photos of who you may miss while you are traveling and they will put print the pictures and put them up in your room. Fun surprise even for the teenage boys. (I sent photos of our dogs.) We love the Kimpton Hotels and this was no exception. A lovely hotel in a great location with an exceptional staff. Also, their restaurant the Jsix was fantastic, we dined there with the boys and shared many starters, salads, sides and a charcuterie board. Probably the most delicious fun meal we had in San Diego. We will definitely stay at Hotel Solamar again when we head back to San Diego. Thank you for making us feel so welcome, we truly enjoyed our stay.Judith, you are very welcome! We truly enjoyed having you here, I am thrilled that you and the boys had such a wonderful visit. We can't wait to welcome you back. Cheers!

As a matter of fact cruisers can be seen dragging their bags from the cruise pier to the hotel the walk is so short. The hotel is modern style and from the interior one could be anywhere in a Westin. Room was large and comfortable, clean. Didn't use the restaurants or bar as preferred to walk down to Harbor area. Very good advance purchase internet rate made it even more attractive. Will stay here again.notnecessary - Thank you for sharing your feedback with Trip Advisor. We find our location to be perfect for all types of guests. We are centrally located between several neighborhoods making it easy to walk and get around without having a vehicle. Always remember to check Westin.com for great promotional rates.

After checking into the hotel, we returned our car early the night before our flight and Rose, the front desk lady suggested that we then take the shuttle from the car rental to the airport and they would pick us up with the hotel shuttle. What a fantastic idea. No bags to move out of the rental car.The room was comfortable and clean. I think the beds were the most comfortable on our trip. No refrigerator or microwave, but they do have a restaurant in the place that was most pleasant.We didn't use the pool, but it looked quite nice.The noise from the planes was not even heard due to the air conditioner in the room.Thank you very much for taking the time to share your comments about your stay with us. It is our hope that you can visit us again soon the next time you visit Phoenix.Kind Regards,Griselda MenaAssistant Manager","Easy Place to Get to Airport","Mount Vernon","Washington","ravenlady","http://www.citysearch.com/profile/1653148/phoenix_az/best_western_airport_inn.html,https://foursquare.com/v/best-western-airport-inn/4bb4310e737d76b0633a3b7c,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g31310-d73706-Reviews-Best_Western_Airport_Inn-Phoenix_Arizona.html","http://book.bestwestern.com/bestwestern/US/FL/Orlando-hotels/BEST-WESTERN-Airport-Inn---Suites/Hotel-Overview.do?propertyCode=10302&sob=YEXTGEN&cm_mmc=BL-_-YEXTGEN-_-GEN-_-LINK,https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/hotel-rooms.03062.html?iata=00171890&ssob=BLBWI0003G&cid=BLBWI0003G:yext:website:03062"

The room was quiet and clean, but very small. My friend and I were climbing over each other and our suitcases to move around the room. One thing that ruined the room for us was the lack of control over the temperature of the room. The weather in Chicago that week was in the mid-upper 60s, but the room was WARM. There's an A/C unit in the room, but no matter what we did to fiddle with it, it just would not get cool. Tiny room + humidity from showers + stubborn A/C + poor window ventilation stuffy stuffy stuffy.What also wasn't fun was being charged an extra 6.35 on my credit card when I checked my billing statement a week after checking out. I called in to ask about the charge and was told we had used the water in the mini bar. We had not. The front desk employee was nice enough to remove the charge, but is it not standard hotel practice to provide a bill of charges to guests before they check out Not doing so is at best questionable (why risk upsetting guests by not verifying mini bar purchases), and at worst predatory (are you just hoping we wouldn't notice). Also, 6 for a bottle of water I get better deals at movie theaters...In conclusion, if you're looking to be in Chicago on a budget, want to be in a good location, and only plan to use the hotel to sleep at night, then the Freehand might be for you. Just make sure to keep an eye on your bank account.Hello Jade Y, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I am glad your stay was mostly enjoyable. I am sorry to hear, however, that the room was a little stuffy. I hope this will not stop you from returning in the future. I am also sorry you had a billing error. While I am glad the front desk took care of the issue, I am sorry to hear that it was incorrect. I hope you will consider returning to Freehand again in the future.","Decent stay, but questionable policies and stuffy rooms.","Arlington","Virginia","711jadey","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d7375440-Reviews-or10-Freehand_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d7375440-Reviews-or170-Freehand_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html#REVIEWS,http://www.yellowbook.com/profile/freehand-chicago_1897726113.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d7375440-Reviews-or235-Freehand_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d7375440-Reviews-or50-Freehand_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d7375440-Reviews-or350-Freehand_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html#REVIEWS,https://www.yellowbook.com/profile/freehand-chicago_1897726113.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d7375440-Reviews-or415-Freehand_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d7375440-Reviews-or440-Freehand_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d7375440-Reviews-or155-Freehand_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d7375440-Reviews-or5-Freehand_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d7375440-Reviews-or420-Freehand_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d7375440-Reviews-or20-Freehand_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d7375440-Reviews-or125-Freehand_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d7375440-Reviews-or365-Freehand_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d7375440-Reviews-or205-Freehand_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d7375440-Reviews-or265-Freehand_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d7375440-Reviews-or130-Freehand_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html#REVIEWS","https://freehandhotels.com"

The breakfast area staff and housekeeping staff (esp. Vilma) were great, as well. The hotel's location (in the center of Waikiki) was good, too. If I had to criticize anything at the hotel - (1) the egg preparations at breakfast could possibly be better and more varied (from day to day) and there could, maybe, be more breakfast meat options (instead of just the alternating bacon-and-sausage option) and (2) the shower/tub in our room was a bit dated (although it worked OK, and was never a real problem).Aloha Jerome S,Mahalo for staying at the Waikiki Gateway Hotel.

I'm sure great for families of students attending SDSU, but not a place I'd really recommend if you want to come for even a short vacation in San Diego. However, the staff was friendly and accommodating, and the rooms were clean and maintained. Parking lot is on the small side and the breakfast area is really, really tight. Lots of construction happening in the area, making navigating the streets a bit more difficult. You need a car to get around, walking will get you to fast food places only. Overall, an OK place for a short stop.Dear Valued Guest, hank you for your review about your recent stay at our hotel. I was pleased that our staff made your stay a pleasurable one. They truly are a large part of why we rate so highly with our guests. I am sorry you were disappointed in our location. As you mentioned, we are an excellent choice for travelers visiting SDSU, one of Californias largest universities (1 mile), or Qualcomm Stadium (2 miles), but we are also close to major freeways that can get you to many attractions, usually under 15 minutes. Regarding restaurants in the area, the staff has a list of really excellent restaurants within a mile or so of the hotel. These are not big, fancy restaurants, but many of them are very nice, including Bridges Bar Grill, only a block away from the hotel. This is one area where our dedication to customer service really shows, we try to direct our guests to local places that we love ourselves.You mentioned the construction, it is true, our neighborhood is going through some major changes that we are very excited about. New commercial and housing buildings are sprouting up, they will bring new energy to our area.It is sometimes a challenge to set the right expectations for our guests. I think we do a pretty good job on our website, and the majority of our guests have written honest reviews about their experience with us, what makes us standout from the rest and why they rate us so highly on TripAdvisor. Our hotel is a modest AAA 2-diamond property, with amenities and prices that reflect that rating. We believe it is well located, friendly and very clean. We make sure that the grounds are lush and well kept, we never charge for parking, internet, breakfast or movies.We appreciate the time you took to review your stay with us. We do hope to see you again soon.Yours in Hospitality,* Book Direct with Us - For the Best Service, Selection, and Value! * Yours in Hospitality, Len General ManagerBest Western Lamplighter Inn Suites

Hmm, maybe need to rethink my sources It was fine. But really - another 'cool industrial hotel' with large common areas to hang with other hotel guests. Yikes. We had a large room with a balcony. Sliding walls were good but the weird blue velvet curtain that separated the bathroom from the bedroom was weird. There were 5 sinks in our room. One in the toilet room, two that overlooked the living room and two that overlooked the bedroom. Why Then there was a 'super cool' shower with clear glass that said SEXY and another shower that was frosted that said NOT SEXY. What No tub. No closet. A corner with a place to hang some clothes next to the sexy shower....and a smaller blue velvet curtain. NO! Maybe I am just too old for this place Give me a nice bathroom with a great shower, double sink and a deep tub..a coffee pot and a great bed and I am happy. Hey! Thanks for the feedback.

It was end of the year of 2015, the weather is very cold for us who came from the South East Asia country, what's to be mentioned of our dissatisfaction is the heater in which we were told is centralized that our room is freezing cold even we have requested to adjust the temperature. The service at the front desk as we are noticing the people are keep changing throughout our stay, there are one or two who are on the night shift, the respond to the request of services are rather poor and inefficient, perhaps the hotel can improve on managing the people, we felt we are not properly taken care of. Nevertheless, when we ask for directions or some other questions regarding the area, especially people who are in the morning shift at the front desk are very helpful and friendly. We are glad to have free hot drinks at the lobby and also maps travel guide conveniently provided - especially the Big Bus Tour tickets are available to get from the hotel! Last but not least, the condition of the room is considerably fine, as we booked the room with private bathroom, however the bathroom, on one of the night when it was raining around the area of San Francisco, the hot bath doesn't seems to work properly and we were extremely cold after taking shower, despite the hotel has provided us extra blanket, yet we do hope the hotel will improve on the condition of the room :)","Disappointment....","Kuala Lumpur","Malaysia","Danielle_Ang","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d1648046-Reviews-or200-Casa_Loma_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d1648046-Reviews-or290-Casa_Loma_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.yellowbook.com/profile/casa-loma-hotel_1843074955.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d1648046-Reviews-or135-Casa_Loma_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d1648046-Reviews-or285-Casa_Loma_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,http://www.yellowbook.com/profile/casa-loma-hotel_1843074955.html","https://www.casalomahotelsf.com"

Internet rates were 130/night, but I was able to get a (smallish) room with private bath for 80+ tax by asking directly through the hotel.Hotels can be pretty expensive in SF, average rate for a decent place is usually close to 200/night. I used to recommend the Elements Hotel to a certain brand of visitor (just need the basics, spend a lot of time out, location is key), but Elements is no more, having been converted to veteran housing. So, Tropica it is now, which is slightly nicer and a little more expensive.My room was clean and modern. At the back of the hotel, with great natural light. Bathroom seems brand new. Comes with mini fridge and microwave. Does not seem to be daily maid service. Free WiFi, which is spotty at the back of the hotel (they also have a dedicated PC for guest use at the check in window).If you like to go out to eat, bar hop, listen to live music, shop for trendy clothes, location here is ideal - it is literally surrounded by restaurants, with some of the most heralded - Locanda, Mission Chinese, Foreign Cinema, Bar Tartine, Range - all within easy walking distance. Too many bars, of all types, to mention - from Mexican bars with mariachis to some of SF's most creative cocktails. And live music within a short walk - the new Chapel, the old Elbo Room, which has had Sunday late night reggae dance parties for over 10 years, and one of my favorites, Amnesia, a quirky little romantic place with excellent, lesser heard music, from Balkan and Gypsy jazz to bluegrass, punk karaoke, folksy singer/songwriters, etc.Hotel is less than 2 blocks from 16th/Mission BART, which goes straight to SFO. Also close to Dolores Park and Castro.Tropica is not for everyone. I give it 3.5 stars overall. But if you want more than a hostel, and can live without full service, and being right in the action is important, this is a very good bargain.","Great spot for budget travellers in search of nightlife","Oakland","California","SantoGabacho","https://www.yellowbook.com/profile/hotel-tropica_1898289742.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d282764-Reviews-or5-Hotel_Tropica-San_Francisco_California.html#REVIEWS,https://foursquare.com/v/hotel-tropica/4c301e7266e40f47c92ec38b,http://www.yellowbook.com/profile/hotel-tropica_1898289742.html","http://www.hoteltropica.com"

I called a week before our travel date to request a King Non-Smoking Room. The front desk receptionist informed me that the room was already booked for a King Non-Smoking. I informed them that I had spoken with someone earlier and was promised the King room. She wanted to know with whom I spoke. I did not take the young ladies name. Where I come from when someone tells you they will do something they are suppose to do it! They had given away our room and we had to settle for Queen Non-Smoking. They had no explanation or common courtesy to offer for their mistake. This hotel was absolutely Filthy. It smelled terrible. Every corridor reeked of air freshener trying to cover up the unpleasant odors. They do not maintain anything. The lobby, corridor, and elevator was so bad that I actually dreaded going into the room. Every inch of floor was covered with something that needed swept, mopped, or vacuumed. The room ceiling had huge water stains, curtains had some huge black mystery stain on them. The carpet was sticky. The bathroom floor was slippery with God only knows what. The room did not smell fresh at all. The fabric furniture had huge stains all over it. It was so bad I was afraid to put my clothes or belongings anywhere. I ended up removing the comforter and laying it over the sofa so we could put our things down. I did not remove my socks in the room my entire stay. The bed was extremely uncomfortable. The bedding was old, tabby, and scratchy. The pillows were like rough paper. The kitchen was dirty the sink had gunk in the bottom. Floors were not swept well. The A/C unit was so loud it was like a piece of machinery was in the room with us. The person above us stomped their floor all night. You can hear everything through the walls inside. You can also hear everything from the outside of the hotel as well. Very old building that needs an absolute demolition and remodel inside. I have stayed in many hotels in my time, but this one was absolutely disgusting. Then the next morning when we were ready to get the heck outta there the front lobby attendant informed my husband that he needed to pay more for the room. She refused to check us out until my husband paid her. She claimed we had been put in the wrong room. Yes thanks to them we had! Because they gave away our room! We had already paid for our room through priceline. The transaction was complete. She wanted my husband to give her a receipt from the previous afternoon when we checked in. They didn't give us anything at that time. She wanted to know who checked us in so she could scold them. Guess what SHE DID! She would not look at the booking in her system and flat out accused my husband of lying about the fact that he paid through priceline. She told him she couldn't take his word for it. Okay fine, then look into your own computer system the information is there! He had to call me inside from our car and I literally had to pull up the priceline information that she refused to look for herself on her computer from my phone. She was trying to charge us 99.00 dollars inclusive of tax for a room we had already paid for. She still argued with my husband and refused to speak to him directly. She kept yelling the same thing asking who checked us in. Again SHE DID! She was the rudest front desk attendant I have ever dealt with. Finally after she was satisfied with the receipt on my phone, she still held us there so she could call their own help line to fix the problem. She finally let us go and never gave us our receipt from them. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. I don't suggest you do either.","Worst Hotel Stay Of My Life!!!!","Houston","Texas","Sam M","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109427-Reviews-or135-Extended_Stay_America_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109427-Reviews-or95-Extended_Stay_America_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109427-Reviews-or110-Extended_Stay_America_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109427-Reviews-or130-Extended_Stay_America_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109427-Reviews-or30-Extended_Stay_America_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109427-Reviews-or35-Extended_Stay_America_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.yellowpages.com/dallas-tx/mip/extended-stay-america-dallas-market-center-483333526,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109427-Reviews-or20-Extended_Stay_America_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109427-Reviews-or80-Extended_Stay_America_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109427-Reviews-or150-Extended_Stay_America_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.yellowbook.com/profile/extended-stay-america_1876509026.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109427-Reviews-or45-Extended_Stay_America_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109427-Reviews-or15-Extended_Stay_America_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109427-Reviews-Extended_Stay_America_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109427-Reviews-or70-Extended_Stay_America_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109427-Reviews-or145-Extended_Stay_America_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109427-Reviews-or90-Extended_Stay_America_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109427-Reviews-or75-Extended_Stay_America_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d109427-Reviews-or125-Extended_Stay_America_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS","https://www.extendedstayamerica.com"

Great room amenities, refrigerator, safe, plenty of power outlets and usb ports for charging electronics and even a mini bar with great snacks. And roof top deck for hanging out which was little used by the guest when I was there, so I had it all to myself. There's even a great cafe attached to the hotel with excellent food. But the real star was the staff. Always friendly, interested in the quality of your stay and very helpful at all hours of the day and night.Reading your review has brought me so much joy, thank you for sharing your experience with the rest of the world.

Saks 5th Ave is a few blocks away, Japantown is a brisk 15 minute walk...Friendly hotel staff, valet parking (35/night) The hotel is a quirky older building (not a bad thing), with dead-end corridors ending at full-height windows looking out onto the street, glass walls looking down into restaurant/common areas. Personality Hotel Group has added a modern sleek look to the whole place. Blue elevator buttons, stainless headboard that peels away to reveal the wall, Artemide night table swing arm lamps, simple modern shower fixtures all add to the industrial chic. The shower was strong, room had complimentary wireless, filing drawer dresser, writing desk, Swing-arm flat screen TV, bertoia diamond chairs, room safe, separate washsink area. Bathroom was a little small and tiles looked like they could use some cleaning and some grout. The bed was comfortable and room was clean, other than the bathroom tiles.Gym was small and a little depressing-blinds were pulled closed to hide the roof fans, gym door probably could have used glass so it didn't seem like you were working out in a prison gym.Business center was nice-I printed out directions to our Sonoma hotel.There is a Starbucks attached through the lobby and a mexican restaurant (we did not try, but looked upscale)Overall, a nice stay in an older building with some decent modern updates.How we got the best rate: 229 New Year's Eve, 129 Jan 1st. After searching around, we got the best rate by booking early on the Diva website directly.","Stylish update to an older building in the heart of Union

We loved all this hotel has to offer, both in location and fun amenities. We loved the dart board in our hotel room and have looked everywhere for one like it for our own home. The game room, patio and all the fun places to sit and relax are fantastic. They didn't seem to have any board games etc...but there was plenty to do with shuffle board, ping pong etc. We hope to come back again in a year or two. Thanks Hotel Zephyr!!Greetings jam0nes,You are most welcome. Thank you for sharing your amazing memories of your stay at Hotel Zephyr.

So we decided to stay at Lowe's on market Street because it was so close to the venue. From the moment we pulled the car into the valet parking the help and staff were more than exemplary. Check-in was a breeze they were more than helpful and we were in our room within five minutes. Our room was very contemporary and decorated nicely. It was also very nice to see people staying with their pets, I didn't know that it was a pet friendly hotel. next visit I certainly will bring my dog.There was a threat of rain and quite a few of the employees informed us that we could get umbrellas at the valet desk that they would loan you very nice touch.

a bit late writing this but ah well, we went to orlando as part of our honeymoon last year, (20 may) we wanted a hotel near the main attractions and somewhere to sleep. this hotel was clean, the staff were very help full, its in a fantastic location....6 for a taxi to universal, r a 10 min walk. ..disney is a lot further away but we were not so interested in that. the staff were always helpfull if we needing information. the hotel is across from wet and wild, there is an ihop bus stop outside, plenty food places, and there are a few bus routes too.the only downside of the hotel was the breakfast, it was only toast and cereal....but to be quite honest there are so so many cheap food places around that you dont nee dto have breakfast in the hotelit is a busy hotel, there were a lot of kids there when we were, which could be quite annoying.....but everyone is there to have a good time!!! our room was cleaned every day and we got fresh towels....there is a plaque in the bedroom, if you want your bed stripped then you put it on the bed, we only done this once, and the bed was stripped and made fresh.......all the people moaning about not having a stripped and fresh bed everyday....do you do that at home i doubt it, so why moan about it on holidaythey have free wi-fi in the lobby and at certain areas by the pool.i would stay at this hotel again no bother, its good value for money, its a basic hotel and you have to keep this in mind when you go, if your looking for a good location, and a clean hotel its great!!! :)","great for price, brilliant

The location is perfect if you plan to hang around the fisherman's wharf area.The hotel is small, as are the rooms, however it has that cosy feel to it. The rooms are cleaner daily and there is an almost constant supply of tea, coffee (plus flavourings and toppings), muffins and sweets, which make for great pre-breakfast or post-dinner snacks.The reception staff were great with us and were on hand to offer help and advice when we needed it. Our only complaint is that due to the size and proximity of the rooms, noise resonates easily. This is not a good thing when the cleaning staff flood the corridors in the morning and talk at an inconsiderate volume. The hotel acknowledges this and provide ear buds next to the beds. I would return here, but will know better than to expect a lie-in in future Thank you for your recent review. We are glad that you found our location, staff and free beverages all day to be a plus for our hotel.Our cozy rooms maintain the same size as when the hotel was built back in 1906. We try to keep the original layout and feel of a historic Inn.Our housekeeping staff has been spoken to and we addressed a memo to them regarding the noise you experienced. Loud conversations by the housekeeping staff in the hallways, especially in the morning, should not be happening anywhere in the hotel. It is with such guest feedback we can make positive changes to the hotel and we really appreciate your honest and positive feedback. We hope to welcome you back soon at the San Remo Hotel.","Great place if you're on a budget","Newcastle upon Tyne","UnitedKingdom","Andy

We used the hotel's underground parking garage. Bryan, a hotel empolyee who opened the parking garage security gate, assisted us with parking our car by directing my husband into a parking spot. While Bryan, stood behind our car, he directed my husband into backing into a very tight parking space. Bryan continued to direct my husband while he backed into the space until Bryan said you are on the wall! When my husband pulled forward we saw massive areas of paint had been scraped off our car. NOT once did Bryan indicate the car was about to hit the wall. Bryan never apologized. We told Michael,who was working at the front desk, about the incident. But because we had friends waiting on us for dinner we did not fill out an Incident Report at that time. When we returned later that night we spoke to Ruby ( who was working at the front desk) about the incident and she advised us that we needed to talk to Candice Hudson, GM, who would be in the next morning betweem 9-10AM. We were then given a Wyndham Garden Incident Report form. The next morning we went to talk to Ms. Hudson only to be told she would not be in. But we did ask to see the security video tape of the incident which an empolyee showed us. We then asked who could we talk to about an incident report with and we were told Ms. Elysia Smith, manager on duty. When we had the opportunity to speak with Ms. Elysia Smith her immediate response: was since my husband was driving the vehicle then the hotel had no liability even though her empolyee directed my husband into the space. I asked for a copy of the incident report we had completed and was told by Ms. Elysia Smith we could not have one (as copies are prohibited). An empolyee suggested we take a picture of the report and Ms. Smith immediatley chastised him for his suggestion. WE are extremely disappointed the way the accident was handled. If Wynndham wants hard line, no empathy, and rude general managers then Ms. Smith is a perfect fit. As of October 26-27, 2018 there is no signage in the garage to direct traffic to exit. The concrete columns in the garage are huge and straddle two parking spaces. According to Bryan, the coulmns are wrapped to prevent cars from scrapping them--so the hotel must expect all the columns to be hit. Our hotel room was spacious as it was a handicapp accessible room and the beds were comfortable. The interior of the hotel is beautiful and spacious. Good location for walking to Canal Street and the Quarter. But with management's attidude toward us, our visit was not pleasureable and we will not stay there again.Thank you for taking the time to write a review on your most recent stay with us. We apologize if your stay was not 100 satisfactory for we do value your business and strive to ensure every guest experience is positive.

Working with the team to set up the room block was made so easy by the incredible staff. Upon our stay, everyone at the hotel went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and were welcoming and friendly. The hotel has recently renovated the rooms and the lobby/check in area is much more inviting than it was before. Being in NYC, hotel rooms are usually pretty small but I thought these rooms were a good size. I moved into the suite for two nights and that had great views and was big enough for my bridal party and I to get ready in. We hosted brunch on Sunday in the private room at San Marino restaurant next door and it was the perfect send off for our guests. We heard that dinner at San Marino was excellent too, which is also where the room service at Four Points comes from.

The hotel is convenient to the highway but there's really nothing else around the property.The property is modern and fairly clean. The room was nicely made up and had some useful amenities like a fridge, microwave, and sink. The TV and wifi worked well. Unfortunately, the free popcorn ends up on the floors in the elevator and and the carpet in the hallways which looks messy.

Whenever we're in Miami, it's the perfect landing spot. The service is consistently excellent. The staff makes a conscious effort to find ways for guests to be comfortable, leaving stress behind. The Restaurant there is so good.. farm to table, with great options. Shout out to Jennifer- the most personable waitress! The rooms are decorated and designed to step into a fully updated motel of the past- but better. There were NO motels like this in the 50's! The showers, the lighting.. even the smallest details lend themselves to the laid back environment. They have pool parties near the outdoor, colorfully lit bar each night- frankly they close down at just the right hour and we've never been disturbed. If you're looking for an alternative to 'South Beach crazy', this reasonably priced oasis is a find.Thank you for your return visit and so glad you not only enjoyed the pool bar but also the restaurant.

We were a little early for check in, but Emma was very kind and found us an available room. We had plenty of time to clean up and head to the restaurant, which was close enough to get to in a timely manner, even at rush hour. Beds were super cozy, breakfast was extensive and decent: waffles, biscuits and gravy, cereals, yogurt, fruit, good coffee. Candace checked us out and was genuinely concerned that we had a good stay. Like she owned the place concerned. Rare and wonderful service. Only complaint was our shower rod was a bit rusty and the hot/cold valve a bit temperamental. Would definitely stay here again.Julie R.

We stayed on a corner 2 bedroom suite with views of other casino buildings on the strip. Check-in and out was quick with no lines. Staff members are friendly and accommodating. Our room was clean and has all the amenities for a typical condo time share property. My kids did not attend the children's program /play ground but we always see kids with attendants on the play area every morning from our room. The pool was small and I wish it was larger considering that it is a time share property and most of their guests are families with kids. Parking (valet only) is free which is great considering that MGM properties on the strip charged for parking. My main complaint is the long wait for getting our car. We always waited for at least 15 minutes or longer to get our car.

The rooms were fine and the beds very comfortable.They have a small indoor pool, which I enjoyed early in the morning when it was empty. Though I didn't use the rest of the spa, it seemed to be clean and well equipped.The only thing that really bothered me is how they nickle and dimed you. 14.95 for internet (which we were lucky to get free as part of the convention rate) and 5 for a bottle of water that is out on the table with an invitation to refresh yourself... That said, when I checked in, the front desk offered me a cold drink, which was a nice touch.I am glad you enjoyed your visit at the Waverly and appreciate the feedback.

We had never stayed there before, and it was so great. As we arrived they offered us sparkling wine and water, took us to our room which was lovely, and showed us around. We took advantage of the free arrival margaritas, as low point, as I think they forgot the tequila!, but it was a nice offer. We also used the jacuzzi which was clean and nice in the evening with candles and a fire in the pool area. Everyone was super friendly, and the facilities were great, although they were being re-modeled at the time, which wasn't the best. We ate at Adobe El Restaurante for breakfast which was absolutely delightful. We would definitely recommend a visit to this charming hotel.Thank you for taking the time to write such a fantastic review. Im glad you had a chance to enjoy things like the whirlpool and breakfast in Adobe El Restaurante. You will have to come back and visit the Spa next time, it is going to look great after the enhancement project is complete in just a couple more weeks!","Great Time.","Wrightwood","California","Lily

This hotel is on a hillside, so if you can't handle doing stairs, then this may not be the place for you. However, the hillside affords nice vistas of San Diego. Great to have a margarita in the restaraunt and look down on Old Town. Weekends can be noisy due to party crowd in Old Town, but week days are quiet.Thank you for leaving impressions of your stay. The Old Town Tequila Factory is our new restaurant and indeed, offers panoramic views of San Diego. Many rooms at the hotel also offer great views. We look forward to your next stay!

And it was during my business trip visit to Atlanta. Location, location, location. So convienent to the MARTA transit line, travel from the airport is quick and efficient. Hotel staff and food during our business meetings was flawless. Lobby bar was a bit pricey, and would make me walk to nearby establishments if more than a drink or two were needed. Rooms were clean and well appointed. Beds and linens were very comfortable. Super staff performance at every level.Dear Don W,Thank you for sharing about your visit to JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead. We appreciate the kind remarks about our service as well as facilities and are glad you could discover the timeless elegance of our hotel, located in the heart of Atlanta's vibrant business, shopping and entertainment district.

Couldn't believe it could be as good as I was reading for the price I was given. Well it is everything and more. It is a 3 floor hotel with elevator and easy to climb stairs. The room was just beautiful, as nice as a 5 star hotel I had previously stayed in. They offer a free breakfast with juic3, coffee, eggs, bacon, waffles, donuts, toast, danish and more. I couldn't believe how much when I walked in. The room was a bit small but people were nice with making room. This hotel is so close to Old Town and Sea World you never need to get back on the freeway unless you chooose to. I went up to Mission Bay and followed that into Old Town. Rooms are a great size also and lots of parking available. Its a fantastic hotel to choose and I will stay here on my next San Diego visit. The staff was the friendliest people I have ever met. The man who checked me in made sure I was happy and under stood everything. Pool has a code and he explainex that and it opened very easily. Nice pool abd nice spa. I liked that when I checked in the gentleman wrote the pool code and breakfast hours on the paper that held the room key. Very very professional and friendly. I didnt want to go home. Great Hotel. Thank You Best Western Mission Bay for making my two days the best ever.Good Afternoon,I am trilled to know you had a fantastic stay with us here at the Best Western Mission Bay. I'm glad that you enjoyed your stay and were happy with our staff, service and our Hot Continental Breakfast. Here at the Best Western Mission Bay we work hard to deliver a great service and clean rooms, and Im glad we were able to provide that for you.If you ever return to San Diego, youre welcome to contact

Unlike many other hotels in the area, parking and wifi is free. What really made this hotel special was the staff. Tony, Damar, Kim, and Francene were all extremely helpful and are very good at recommending good places to eat. The King bed I had was extremely comfortable and had a nice desk in the room. The morning breakfast actually exceeded my expectations.Thank you so much for your review. We enjoy being able to provide optimal customer service for our guests!

I do want to counter a few statements from post-reviews about the outdated feel and the ikea like furniture. It's very understandable for someone to not feel that The Pearl is up to date. The architecture of the building is old, yes, and the furniture, yes, but that's the idea behind the movement of this hotel. Seldom these days do you find such a gem that supports and honors the art of MCM. The whole idea is to feel that your living in a 1950-60's dwell magazine ad. Playing episodes of soul train in the courtyard should sell anyone. Good on you folks at The Pearl for keeping the beauty of MCM alive. The Restaurant was incredible, and the support of local and sustainable, is a breathe of fresh air. The staff are charming, funny, and all good looking. Thank you!

Unfortunately, it also has some aspects that didn't live-up to expectation. The parking was free, which in any downtown hotel is a good thing. Sadly, many of the cars are double-parked, which means leaving the key with reception. When we were ready to check-out, we had to wait for ten minutes for the receptionist to find the missing keys to a van that was blocking our exit. The 'free' breakfast wasn't much more than a small table containing coffee, tea bags, hot water and a few pastries (the table sitting in the hotel's lobby which had two chairs). The room was a little scruffy too. The decor was old, the fabrics were very faded and our entrance to the hotel seemed to be held together by the construction that was taking place. If you're looking for a cheap hotel in Downtown SF, this place is ok, just don't expect much.","Friendly but nothing

It's about as hip as morning radio DJs. It tries way to hard to be loose, fun, and alternative, and it misses the mark. You have to check in at a bar. They give you a free drink upon check-in. The focus here seems to be alcoholfun. Unfortunately some of us don't drink. Since the poker chip they give you immediately is cashed in for a rum concoction before you even get the chance to say anything I wouldn't recommend this place for those striving to be sober. I was disappointed by the lack of choice. (Shrug)The rooms are small, but well arranged, and have a great view outside. Unfortunately the hotels hip theme continues into the room, where just like morning radio stations, they try to create a faux funky culture with band name stickers on the door. Fans of Aerosmith, Kiss, Greenday and Red Hot Chili Peppers will enjoy, everyone else who has taste will find it annoying and a desperate attempt to be cool. The bunk beds are a great idea, but not recommended for anyone over 5'6 because their feet will hang off the end of the mattress. I would not recommend the room for people who are sharing who don't want to see each other's silhouettes in the shower since the doors are frosted but see through. The bunk bed room would be a good place for a small family or a couple of close friends. The main lobby of the hotel at night is a busy bar scene. Expect drunks, rude bouncers, and a DJ spinning dance music. The taco bar is open, but expensive. 3+ for a small bottle of water. I would recommend this place for 2 Millennial besties (at least one needs to be a proud owner of a fedora), it's in a good spot, it's a party scene, and people in their 20s don't have the same expectations as the rest of us.Noxiousburrito,Thanks for giving the Moxy Chicago a go! Were sad to hear you didnt enjoy the Moxy experience, but we're glad you gave us a shot. We hope that you enjoyed your time in Chicago and we wish you the best of travels to where ever your road may lead!

We have stayed at several other M.O. properties and their luxury and service are always superb. The room was nice with a large balcony overlooking the city. Our breakfast the following morning was excellent and the service and staff always polite and professional. Our only complaint this trip was confusion over the rate and a glitch at the front desk. We booked a bed and breakfast rate on-line as Fans of M.O. for 279. When looking at our portfolio on the in-room television, it showed 299. I happened to have my printed reservation with me and took it down to the front desk. The young lady at the desk was very apologetic and helpful and while I was standing there, said she changed the rate on the computer. The next morning upon checking out, I asked for a copy of my final bill, and it again showed 299, not the 279 rate on my reservation. I again explained to the young man at the desk and again showed my reservation. He seemed confused why it wasnt changed the evening before and made the correction with apologies. He asked to keep the copy of my reservation. The entire process was handled professionally by both front desk clerks, but had I not checked both times, would have been charged the higher rate. It is a small complaint, but shouldnt have happened in the first place. The reservation was made directly with M.O. reservations, not through a third-party. Both desk clerks seemed confused by the rate on my printed reservation. My suggestion is if you stay at M.O., be sure to check your bill against your reservation. 20 is not the end of the world, but how many people were charged higher rates without realizing it Otherwise,

We were disappointed. The staff were rude at check in and at all other times - no smiles or good mornings/afternoons were offered with one exception, James, who was really nice. The hotel itself appears outdated - there was a musty smell in the corridors and it felt unclean. Our first room was unacceptable as it was covered in dust, the carpet was really dirty, the bed sheets were pulled and tatty, and there were stains on the tiles in the bathroom (not small ones but large off-putting ones). We asked to switch rooms and while our second room was acceptable the carpet was in need of a good clean and we had no curtains - only a black out blind. We did not enjoy our second stay here - so much in fact we booked another hotel after the second night and only returned the night before heading home. We will not be staying here again, the great location does not make up for its shortcomings.Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us, we do apologize that your stay did not meet expectations and want you to know that we will take your comments into consideration as we continually strive for improvement.Rafael Ortiz-MartinezFront Office Manager","Great location - poor hotel","Leeds","UnitedKingdom","Michelle D","https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/sheraton-studio-city.en-gb.html;srpvid=dda506fd9ac500d9;srepoch=1551142779;hpos=10;hapos=310;dest_id=20023488;dest_type=city;sr_order=popularity?from=searchresults,https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/sheraton-studio-city.en-gb.html;srpvid=08d17b4df2cb049c;srepoch=1551461531;hpos=9;hapos=294;dest_id=20023488;dest_type=city;sr_order=popularity?from=searchresults,https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/sheraton-studio-city.en-gb.html;srpvid=972b2cece2b40052;srepoch=1549607001;hpos=11;hapos=326;dest_id=20023488;dest_type=city;sr_order=popularity?from=searchresults,https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/sheraton-studio-city.en-gb.html;srpvid=525f806b5e290003;srepoch=1550427352;hpos=14;hapos=314;dest_id=20023488;dest_type=city;sr_order=popularity?from=searchresults,https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/sheraton-studio-city.en-gb.html;srpvid=e2bb839a6a9c0034;srepoch=1551638581;hpos=13;hapos=298;dest_id=20023488;dest_type=city;sr_order=popularity?from=searchresults,https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/sheraton-studio-city.en-gb.html;srpvid=f9f057cc1ec9064a;srepoch=1551270553;hpos=8;hapos=263;dest_id=20023488;dest_type=city;sr_order=popularity?from=searchresults,http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3712864098/four-points-by-sheraton-orlando-international-drive-orlando,https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/sheraton-studio-city.html;srpvid=85c77c5e228303e6;srepoch=1551721276;hpos=13;hapos=298;dest_id=20023488;dest_type=city;sr_order=popularity?from=searchresults,http://www.citysearch.com/profile/2397869/orlando_fl/four_points_by_sheraton_orlando_international_drive.html,https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/sheraton-studio-city.html;srpvid=6e8969925e9e01db;srepoch=1551538852;hpos=13;hapos=298;dest_id=20023488;dest_type=city;sr_order=popularity?from=searchresults","http://www.marriott.com/,https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/mcofp-four-points-orlando-international-drive/?scid=45f93f1b-bd77-45c9-8dab-83b6a417f6fe"

The room was large with a king size bed and couch that made into a sleeper, clean and the service was good. The breakfast was the usual type that is provided from 6-9 am at hotels and fine for me. The rate was very good for the San Diego area since it not located outside of the main tourist area but the location adjacent to the 15 means that all the major tourist sites and beach is within 20-30 minutes. I highly recommend this hotel for someone traveling and stopping for the night or families on a budget. Dear moocoulter,Thank you for providing feedback regarding your stay at the Best Western San Diego/Miramar. We are thrilled to hear the service was good. We strive in providing our guests with excellent quality service and are touched you took notice. As you mentioned, we do offer complimentary breakfast and are delighted you were able to enjoy it during your stay. We hope to see you again, during your next trip to San Diego. Once more, thank you for reviewing the Best Western San Diego/Miramar.","Convenient

The rooms were clean, modern, new, and comfortable.","Comfort on the Plains","Medina","OH","Dennis C","http://marriott.ugc.bazaarvoice.com/6604-en_us/lbffi/reviews.djs%2525253Fformat%2525253Dembeddedhtml%25252526page%2525253D3,http://marriott.ugc.bazaarvoice.com/6604-en_us/lbffi/reviews.djs%2525253Fformat%2525253Dembeddedhtml%25252526page%2525253D2,http://marriott.ugc.bazaarvoice.com/6604-en_us/lbffi/reviews.djs%2525253Fformat%2525253Dembeddedhtml%25252526page%2525253D1,http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/lbffi-fairfield-inn-and-suites-north-platte/,https://foursquare.com/v/fairfield-inn--suites/4c8e211458668cfa131bcfec,http://tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45737-d1657578-Reviews-Fairfield_Inn_Suites_North_Platte-North_Platte_Nebraska.html,http://marriott.ugc.bazaarvoice.com/6604-en_us/lbffi/reviews.djs%2525253Fformat%2525253Dembeddedhtml%25252526page%2525253D8,http://marriott.ugc.bazaarvoice.com/6604-en_us/lbffi/reviews.djs%2525253Fformat%2525253Dembeddedhtml%25252526page%2525253D7,http://www.yellowpages.com/north-platte-ne/mip/fairfield-inn-suites-north-platte-452405820,http://marriott.ugc.bazaarvoice.com/6604-en_us/lbffi/reviews.djs%2525253Fformat%2525253Dembeddedhtml%25252526page%2525253D6,http://marriott.ugc.bazaarvoice.com/6604-en_us/lbffi/reviews.djs%2525253Fformat%2525253Dembeddedhtml%25252526page%2525253D5,http://marriott.ugc.bazaarvoice.com/6604-en_us/lbffi/reviews.djs%2525253Fformat%2525253Dembeddedhtml%25252526page%2525253D4","https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/lbffi-fairfield-inn-and-suites-north-platte/,http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/lbffi-fairfield-inn-and-suites-north-platte/?scid=45f93f1b-bd77-45c9-8dab-83b6a417f6fe"

Our car stayed comfy and cosy in their parking garage except for the three days we were away from the area. Our room was HUGE. If you want a bigger room than average, get the last room on the city side of the Inn. Employees were pretty great, welcoming and helpful. The only issue we had was with the Clean Remote which did not seem to want its buttons pushed. After asking staff to fix it (which they tried to by replacing the batteries) we discovered an old-fashioned remote in a drawer and used that for the rest of our week stay. Pool and Hot-tub were nice ... pretty much empty every weeknight after 10 pm. Breakfast buffet was so-so. Not the greatest in the world, but I've seen worse at other hotels (stale muffins and donuts and maybe some juice). Dinner at the Bayside Grill wasn't bad either...If we ever return to San Diego (and we definitely might!) we would stay at the Bayside Inn again in a heartbeat.Thank you for staying with us at Best Western Plus Bayside Inn! We are pleased you enjoyed our proximity within downtown made walking to so many things easy. We value your feedback about the remote in your room and our complimentary breakfast buffet. This will aid us with concentrating our efforts to continue to make advancements please accept out apologies for any inconveniences. We are delighted that you will stay with us again and we look forward to welcoming you back!","What a great

Literally checked in on their grand opening (from Portofino to Hilton Garden Inn). There were some technical issues with booking system as confirmations were being transferred over and some were lost. The staff did the best they could and worked with our group. Honestly, it was the employees that saved the day. They were all very personable, helpful and did everything to ease their remodel transition. Rooms are all newly upgraded and served our needs. Pool a little small but the kids loved it. Breakfast was great and bartender was awesome in the evening. Location in walking distance to food and gas if you're traveling. You're only 10 to 15 minutes away from tourist attractions and easy access to the freeway. Great location away from downtown but very close. Love the fact that they're family friendly. We'll be back.Dear svcager,Thank you for your kind words and feedback, we truly appreciate all of your comments!

It's just a few minutes to the 72nd street subway, The Dakota where Lennon was shot, Central Park and Strawberry Fields. The neighborhood is very residential and in a no-honk zone which makes it quiet. This is about the only good thing about the hotelHotel: The hotel can't even really be called a hotel. It's a youth hostel without an age restriction. In each room you get a bed, a small TV a mirror and a sink. That's it! You have to leave a deposit at the front desk for sheets and they are not the cleanest in the world. The bathrooms are shared. Each bathroom has a toilet and a shower. Imagine how long it takes for you to wait to do your business in the morning! The lifts are ancient and slow. The front desk could really care less about you being there.The only reason we booked this hotel was because we needed to get to New York on the cheap for my wife to audition for the show Project Runway. There was some other even going on at the time and hotel prices were 3X what they usually go for. For 100 a night, we weren't expecting much.

But thats about the only positive with my experience.You generally know what youre getting with a Residence Inn. Thats why I stay at them frequently. I had never experienced anything like this one before. Inside the hotel its dated and dirty. Outside the hotel room its run down and pure ghetto.Many hotels are close to a freeway or interstate. This one is no exception. The difference: its like right there, right outside my window. It was very difficult to sleep at night due to the traffic. Moreover, sirens seemed to be going off constantly. Ive attached a photo to show how close the freeway really is, and you can see an emergency vehicle with its lights and sirens blaring.I tried to go outside for a walk yesterday. Bad idea! Cop cars everywhere and the neighborhood didnt seem very safe. Im not sure what a Residence Inn is doing in this area, anyway. Seems like it needs to be torn down and built somewhere completely different.The inside of the room and the whole property are incredibly dated and dirty. Here are a few examples.See attached photo of a TV in the bedroom. Its so smallbasically the size of an average computer monitor. I havent seen a TV that small in a hotel room since the 80s.Another attached photo is of the pillow case. Looks like theres either blood or pizza sauce on it. Im not sure which one, and I probably dont want to know.Another attached photo shows just one area (the vent by the kitchen) and how dusty/dirty it is.These are just a few examples. Overall, Im very disappointed and would never even consider staying here again. The worst part is, I traveled with some co-workers who are staying at a Homewood Suites down the road. Im a Marriott guy so I went out of my way to stay here. Their hotel ended up being MUCH nicer.Dear Guest,Thank you for sharing your experience and our opportunity for improvement. I will address these areas with our team since these items should have been resolved prior to your arrival. I apologize for a less than expected guest experience.Our guest stay and experience is important to us so we will look at ways to improve our cleaning and inspection processes to that we do not cause disruption to our guest.

The room was so good. Comfortable and clean, we really enjoyed relaxing on the sofa at the end of each day. Beds were comfortable, linens were soft, and the kitchen was supplied with glassware and plates to enjoy dinner with our shoes off. Amina at the front desk always greeted us with a smile and was helpful in answering all our questions. The shuttle made getting around town very easy, though when you are across the street from Seattle Center, you really don't need to use it much! The view from our room was the Space Needle, and I loved it. Breakfast was surprisingly large and varied from day to day kudos to the breakfast staff for keeping the buffet area well stocked and clean. I hope to return, as I very much enjoyed my stay. Try this when you go to Seattle!Dear WandaP,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel on Trip Advisor! I am very glad to hear that you had a great stay and that you enjoyed our location across the street from the Space Needle! I will pass onto the staff that you enjoyed our free breakfast buffet and thought their service was deserves kudos! I hope the next time you are in town you choose us again!

My wife and I found the French market inn in 2011 and I stay there now ever time I'm in town. There are three reasons I like it. One it's one of the least expensive hotels in the French Quarter (often less than 100 per night) Two it's one of the nicest, cleanest,and quaint hotels in the French Quarter. Third and most important to me is location. It looks directly across Decatur street at the Mississippi River, is two blocks from Jackson square, three blocks from cafe dumonde, 5 blocks from bourbon street, and about seven blocks to the casino.The only thing I can say that I don't like is the valet service. They are not always available at check in time and Decatur is a very busy street so getting one of the three available unloading spots can be tough. If you pack light and don't plan on moving your car often I would suggest parking across the street in the large lot adjacent to the old Jax brewery. 27 for 24 hours which is cheaper than the hotel valet charge per day.I highly recommend this hotel!!!","Frequent New Orleans

Room was set up with two king suites and living/kitchen in the middle. Nice balcony with outdoor dinning set up. Fully equipped kitchen and several community grills on the property. Grocery is walkable (15 min) and beachfront boardwalk is great for morning exercise and evening strolls. Several restaurant options walkable. This part of the island was nice for us - short drive to Whalers Village for shopping and restaurants and short drive to some great bays and beaches for snorkeling/swimming. Pool was nice and beach in front of hotel was OK, but kind of steep and a bit rocky. This is a new property and I think it is one of the nicest family suites we have stayed at. We felt their introductory pricing available now was well worth the price for the quality and type of environment.Aloha Peter B,Mahalo for your review and feedback! We are excited to hear your kind words and want to thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

This is emphatically NOT a luxury, boutique hotel. It is not artful, luxurious, or intimate as the website claims. It is a poorly maintained, mediocre hotel. Tiny cramped lobby tiny, ancient, slow elevator barely big enough for two people and one piece of luggage each. Cramped room, so small the door to the bathroom only opened half way before it hit one of the two double beds. Old, cheap furnishings (my wife said it was reminiscent of the furnishings she had in her first apartment after college). The mattress was so hard we had to put the comforter under the bottom bed sheet to try to add some softness. Like sleeping on lightly padded plywood. Bathroom had stained grout on the tile, mold in the corners, stains on the mirror, dysfunctional shower head... (I have submitted pictures to document the poor quality and maintenance of the room.) And this was a better room than the first one they put us in. The original room was blazingly hot and the only window for ventilation opened onto a noisy street. At our request, they moved us to the third floor on the back side of the hotel. Three friends of ours got a room here, too, and they complained about the heat and noise. The hotel's breakfast consisted of a bunch of loaves of bread, a toaster, peanut butter and jam, and coffee and tea. There was a small refrigerator and microwave in the room, fortunately. I can only recommend this hotel if you can get a room for 100/night or less and you don't really care about quality or comfort. It's only asset is location. They do have a nice wine bar.Dear Paul H,we are sorry you did not have a good experience at the FItzgerald Hotel. As you have mentioned in your review, boutique hotels have usually a particular style which is different from city to city, and that varies from one boutique hotel to another: the Fitzgerald hotel does have its own unique style, which is a classic post-Victorian San Francisco one, with a furnishing and an elevator that are meant to recall that time. We understand that some customers may not like it, but that is also what makes the Fitzgerald hotel different from the others. Also, since we are downtown, there is nothing much we can do about the noise, but we will follow up on your suggestion and try to see whether we can do some work to better isolate the building from street noise. With respect to the poor maintenance, I have printed out your review and passed it on to our staff who is already working on fixing the issues you were mentioning: thank you very much for that. We hope your experience won't prevent you from staying again with us next time you are in San Francisco, and until then we will work to make sure that most of the issues you have found will be resolved.

I just needed something relatively cheap for a night and it was so expensive downtown. Based on the reviews that I thought were unbiased, I decided to give this a try. Obviously the worst thing about it really is location. It can be down right frightening even. Alone, under a bridge basically. I can see where people would be freaked out. No doubt I wouldn't bring family or a date here. But the check in was friendly. The room was very basic but clean. I could park right outside my door. The A/C worked great. The bed was alright. I dare say comfortable although the sheets didn't exactly fit snug. I had a non-smoking room and I couldn't smell any major lingering smoke smell from any past use which is better than some other budget hotels. Needless to say, this wouldn't be my go-to hotel, but now that I've stayed at it, I would definitely consider it as a backup hotel and if I were solo again. So I feel better about possible future stays. And it was nice that there was a nice bright lit and friendly Raising Cane's nearby. I'm rating it average because that's basically what it is. It's a basic average motel and if you're expecting anything more than that, then you shouldn't be looking here.","It serves it's intended purpose","Baton Rouge","Louisiana","darylwi","https://www.yellowpages.com/new-orleans-la/mip/new-orleans-inn-14144862,http://www.yellowbook.com/profile/new-orleans-inn_1898564034.html","http://www.neworleansinnla.com"

Overall impression is very good. Room was not huge, but adequate, looked modern with fully equipped kitchenette, queen size bed and pullout sofa. Great location, just 10 min straight walk to the best Atlanta Midtown has to offer, 5 min walk to the Art Center MARTA station. We didn't have a car, however I noticed that parking charge was 28 per night. Very good breakfast selection and decent exercise room.

But it didn't have king bed. But it was very clean and bright..room service and house keeping service is not great. A few folks only do a great job, rest all are very slow and not up to the mark If you are an Indian, you will bump into a lot more in the hotel campus. We were new and we made many new friends there.

Pros: Good look, great location, good restaurant in lobby, nice beds and sheets, wifi and the desk helpful and superfast (can't understand complaints in other comments.) The women there were friendly and found us alternatives when the two annex rooms we were first given BOTH smelled strongly of mildew. The rooms we moved into smelled better but it would have been nice if the doors to their terraces locked. I play poker and sometimes leave cash in the room--or I do when I can lock it in. Also, lights broken in one and smoke alarm beeping in another of the 4 rooms: not a big deal, easily fixed, but not a sign of close attention, either. Tower might well be a different story, but l I would say, for now: avoid the annex.","Charming place/avoid annex","New York City","NewYork","Rich

Found our room on the 3rd floor, but there were no lights on on in the room, and it took me ages in the dark to find the lamps!! Not the warmest welcome!!The room was huge and beautifully decorated, and the bed was comfy. The room looked onto Commonwealth Ave. which was nice, but there was lots of noise, especially in the mornings. The bathroom was a little dated, and needed a bit of sprucing up. Very clean otherwise. The breakfast is continental, and there were homemade cookies available from about 4pm, and unlimited tea and coffee. There is no TV in the bedroom, but we didn't mind.Fantastic location, easy walk to Bostom Common and local restaurants. We parked at Boston Common garage, lots of parking, and cost around 25 per day.","Lovely BIG room, great location, OK service....","Perth","Australia","pepe_of_perth","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or80-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.weddingwire.com/reviews/the-college-club-of-boston-boston/157ad4eea9f03d43.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or125-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or180-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or225-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or240-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or5-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or175-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or55-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or75-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or150-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or155-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or215-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or110-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or250-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or185-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or205-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or190-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or85-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.hotels.com/hotel/218266/reviews%20/,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or145-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or195-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or20-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.yellowpages.com/boston-ma/mip/the-college-club-of-boston-14250222,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or95-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://foursquare.com/v/the-college-club-of-boston/4be1b35b8dd062b5bc7c3e3c,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or235-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or200-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or25-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or30-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d280420-Reviews-or70-The_College_Club_of_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html#REVIEWS","http://www.thecollegeclubofboston.com"

San Francisco is very expensive and our son was here with his family for a conference. We liked the location-very close to small markets and restaurants and cable car stops, as well as shopping nearby in Union Square.The staff is very helpful and friendly and check in was fast and easy. The rooms are an average size and the bed was comfortable. There is a mini-fridge in the room as well as a small coffee maker. For some reason our frig kept freezing everything!There are plenty of outlets to charge devices.I only have a few negatives. The bathroom is so small!! You can't stand in front of the sink unless you close the bathroom door! There is really nowhere to hang a towel, except a hand towel. There is very little counter space to put anything. Lighting could be better. There is no light in the entry way where the closet is-so it is very dark to find clothes. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay at the hotel.

Room was clean and fairly spacious but nothing special. Free breakfast was quite good and the location was within walking distance of my office. The biggest knock on this place is the noise level from the street. There is little to any noise proofing, so you are going to hear cars until around midnight. They do provide a white noise generator and I had that thing going every night. It was a pleasure hosting you during your trip, and I'm glad you enjoyed your stay. Since we're located in a metropolitan area, some of our rooms may experience noise from the street below. That said, it's great you were able to make use of the white noise machine.

They have a full fridge, dishwasher, two flat screen tvs and two elements for cooking. Also, plates, pots, pans, ect. It's quiet. Free breakfast. Had an issue with the parking, below is part of my email to Marriott. I initially bid on a one night stay, after successfully winning the bid I was prompted to extend my stay. I was happy to do so after reviewing the location of the hotel, the free breakfast and most importantly the free parking. Because of the two separate reservations, I had to re-check in again for the second night, no big deal. When checking in for the second night I was asked if we had a car with us, which we did. We were informed of the 23 dollar parking fee. I mentioned to the front desk clerk, that it might be on file that I have an email from my successful bid that clearly states the parking was free. (We had the same issue the first night of check in, but I just showed my email and the free parking was granted) The front desk manager Jill took note of the situation and jumped in. Saying very loudly, No, NO, NO! You Priceline People do NOT get free parking, never! It was a little embarrassing to us, that we were being referred to, actually we were being yelled at for using Priceline for our reservation. We mentioned the free parking was one of our main reasons for extending our stay for two nights. Again we were reminded that us Priceline People do not ever get free parking . I asked if I should run up and get my phone (which had the email indicating free parking) to which Jill replied at a much louder voice than was required (since I was right in front of her) yeah, but it wont do you any good, Priceline People never ever get free parking. And then something to the effect of Id like to see this email. As I walked away to get my phone and my wife waited nearby, Jill continued to rant about the situation right in front of my wife as if she wasnt standing there. This was getting very embarrassing for the both of us as there were lots of customers around because the morning breakfast was just wrapping up. I returned with my iPhone, showed the email, free parking was granted, although not without a few extra snarky comments from Jill. No apology, no thanks for being patient, no sorry for the confusion, nothing. Also, worth noting that we were put into a room without a balcony, not sure if that was further punishment for using Priceline. It clearly indicates online that all rooms have a private balcony. If your hotel wants to treat Priceline guest different than other guests, you should probably not make your hotel available to be booked through Priceline.Dear sir,I am very sorry that your experience at the Residence Inn Seattle Lake Union was not to your expectations. I have contacted Priceline to ensure that our information is correct for future travelers. Though it doesn't appear that you were treated this way, I'd like to assure you that guests who book through Priceline can expect the same level of guest service that we pride ourselves on providing to all of our guests. I would like to have the opportunity to speak with you directly about your experience and anything I can do to make it right for you.

I stayed here for one night for an early morning flight. It was very noisy when I checked in for about an hour and then it was very quiet. The staff was very friendly and helpful and did a good job of keeping everything flowing during the renovation. There was plenty of hot water and the water pressure was decent. The towels are new, but the bath towels are small and I'm not a big person. The bed was comfortable and the room was warm even though the outside temp was 5 degrees. I feel the price was high during the renovation.Hello,We sincerely appreciate your feedback! Our public space is scheduled to be finalized very soon! It looks amazing!!

The booking was completely unprofessional, with errors in the booking info. This was corrected after a couple of emails. I then inquired of the cancellation policy. The explanation was first, and I quote, before 24 hours. After inquiring of the meaning of that statement, they modified it to after 24 hours!!! Complete and utter incompetence. This was in the month of January, and my reservation was in April. I then noted the charges for the room appear on my credit card statement in January!!!! I then realized the level of incompetence, and wondered if fraud may be involved. A phone call to the Inn put me in contact with a young lady, who couldn't even find a record of my reservation. She was eventually helpful in finding it and reversing the charge to my account. She also clarified verbally the cancellation policy, which was the standard prior to 24 hours before the date of the stay. After all this, I emailed about a week ago, asking them to cancel my reservation, and confirm by email. No response, so sent a second email asking again for confirmation. No response. I have again emailed, to the attention of the young lady who helped in the past, requesting confirmation of my cancellation. Ed WooleverHello Mr. Woolever, I apologize that you had some issues with your reservation. According to our records which were emailed to you upon your request, your reservation was booked for January 21st, since you failed to checkin on January 21st you were charged for the first night. When you called us to inform us about the charge and your intention to book the room on April 21st, we thought of it as a miscommunication and as a courtesy reversed the charges immediately. Later you emailed us with your intention to cancel the room for April 21st, I emailed you back requesting you to call me for the cancellation (as it is a standard protocol for most hotel reservation cancellation to get a verbal authorization), which you called and canceled within 10 minutes. We sincerely apologize for the initial date mismatch and the charge, I hope we can go pass that and you would give us an opportunity to show you our commitment to customer service by staying with us. If there is anything I can do to persuade you to change your decision please give us a call. Thank you for your feedback, your feedback is very valuable to us since it helps us improve our services.","Watch Out for This One","San Jose","California","SUASEd","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d98704-Reviews-or105-Knights_Inn_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d98704-Reviews-or65-Knights_Inn_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,http://www.superpages.com/bp/dallas-tx/knights-inn-market-center-L0140435133.htm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d98704-Reviews-or180-Knights_Inn_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.trip.com/reviews/paginate_for_place%2525253Fpage%2525253D1%25252526place_type%2525253DHotel%25252526place_id%2525253D5000000223601%25252526tripe_ids%2525253D0%25252526country_code%2525253Dus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d98704-Reviews-or115-Knights_Inn_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.bbb.org/us/tx/dallas/profile/hotels/knights-inn-market-center-0875-90792615,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d98704-Reviews-or75-Knights_Inn_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,http://www.citysearch.com/profile/603135352/dallas_tx/knights_inn_market_center.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d98704-Reviews-or55-Knights_Inn_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d98704-Reviews-or160-Knights_Inn_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d98704-Reviews-or125-Knights_Inn_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d98704-Reviews-or200-Knights_Inn_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d98704-Reviews-or165-Knights_Inn_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d98704-Reviews-or45-Knights_Inn_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d98704-Reviews-or85-Knights_Inn_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d98704-Reviews-or35-Knights_Inn_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,http://www.yellowbook.com/profile/knights-inn-market-center_1896184053.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d98704-Reviews-or70-Knights_Inn_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d98704-Reviews-or155-Knights_Inn_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html#REVIEWS,https://www.trip.com/dallas/hotels/knights-inn-market-center","https://m.knightsinn.com/hotels/texas/dallas/knights-inn-market-center/hotel-overview?WID=LC:KG:2015"

The rooms are spacious, new, clean and the overall service is really good. When I checked-in they gave me 2 free bottles of water and they also have complimentary breakfast :) The only reason why i m not giving 5 stars to this hotel is because they don't offer food service to your room, you would think that they offer this type of service :(.

We got a 2nd floor room over the carport. We brought ear plugs but didn't find the walls to be thin like other reviews. Yes, there is noise outside your room when people are going to and coming from the parks, but that's what we were there for so it didn't bother us. No one used the pool after hours and at most there were only two families at a time using it. We did use it and the hot tub a few times, nice clean. We stayed 5 nights during spring break with no problems. Our car was parked in the carport and was blocked one day but we didn't need to move it as we were going to the parks. It did not get dinged. We used the in-room safe, refrigerator, and microwave. We knew in advance that the only protein at the continental breakfast was hard-boiled eggs so we brought some microwave bacon and made it in our room to supplement. Having breakfast there was such a time-saver. We got an awesome deal with a free night through Get Away Today which included all the fees (resort, safe, taxes) except for the parking (we also knew this in advance), for which we paid 46.80 upon checkout. All the hotel staff we interacted with were very nice and helpful, especially the breakfast attendant. It was so nice to be able to walk to the parks, especially during a busy season when we did not want to waste time with a shuttle or getting in out of parking. My husband found the bed to be too hard toward the end of our stay but the rest of our family slept fine. The A/C worked so well we had to turn it off at times would be more than adequate for summer heat. I honestly feel that some other reviewers are being too picky, expecting a 4 or 5 star hotel.

Hotel was outstanding and staff very helpful. Room was very large and beds really comfortable. Only complaint was price of car parking which was 70 a night and valet parking. The car lot was approximately 2 blocks away which meant could not car was not easily accessible. Dear G1455JOstephenm, Thank you for choosing to stay at the Conrad Chicago and writing of your experience. I'm pleased you were happy with the accommodations but I'm sorry for your disappointment in our parking rates - unfortunately Chicago does have some of the highest parking and parking tax rates in the entire country!
